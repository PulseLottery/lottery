The SimpleLottery contract is a basic lottery system where participants can deposit funds and have a chance to win prizes in random drawings. Here are the rules of this lottery:

1. Deposit: Participants can make deposits to the contract using the `deposit()` function. The minimum deposit amount is 2000 PLS. Upon deposit, the participant's balance is updated, and a portion of the funds is allocated to the respective vaults (hourlyVaultBalance, dailyVaultBalance, weeklyVaultBalance, monthlyVaultBalance) according to predetermined percentage shares.

2. Rewards: Rewards are awarded in random drawings. The contract has four types of rewards: hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly. The rewards are paid out from the corresponding vault that accumulates the deposited funds.

3. Reward Distribution: To claim a reward, participants need to call the appropriate function based on the type of reward. For example, the `sendHourlyReward()` function pays out the hourly reward if at least one hour has passed since the last hourly reward distribution. Similarly, the `sendDailyReward()`, `sendWeeklyReward()`, and `sendMonthlyReward()` functions distribute the daily, weekly, and monthly rewards, respectively, while respecting the designated time constraints.

4. Winner Selection: The winner is randomly selected. Inside the `sendReward()` function, a random participant index is generated based on a random value. The winner receives a reward, which consists of a portion of the funds from the reward pool, and it is transferred to the winner's address. Additionally, a percentage (2%) is deducted as a commission and sent to a specific address.

5. Clearing Participants List: After the weekly and monthly reward distributions, the participants list is cleared by removing all participant addresses. To participate in the next drawing, participants will need to deposit funds again.

The SimpleLottery contract provides a straightforward lottery mechanism where participants can deposit funds, and rewards are awarded through random drawings based on specified rules and time limitations.
